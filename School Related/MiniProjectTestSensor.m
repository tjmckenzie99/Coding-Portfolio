% This code was written so that you can test individual pieces of your MiniProject Sensor (material classifier) Fall 2021.
% code written by Julie Whitney 11/15/2021

% Note this code is meant to be copied and pasted to the command line to check out any particular
% part of the sensor you want to test.

% Start by connecting to the arduino
clear all

a = arduino() %only needed if arduino not connected

% TEST THE LEDs and the PHOTORESISTOR
